<p class="style2">phpLinkDropper License</p>
<p class="style1">phpLinkDropper licence grants you the right to run one instance (a single installation) of the Software on one web server and one web site for each licence </p>
<p class="style1">purchased. Each licence may power one instance of the Software on one domain. For each installed instance of the Software, a separate licence is required.</p>
<p class="style1">You may not redistribute copies or modified copies of any of the files included in the phpLinkDropper distributions under any circumstances.</p>
<p class="style1">A phpLinkDropper License MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED FROM ONE DOMAIN TO ANOTHER. Meaning, if you originally licensed domain1.com and you want to stop using it on </p>
<p class="style1">domain1.com and start using it on domain2.com, you will have to purchase a new license for domain2.com. </p>
<p class="style1">phpLinkDropper may, at its discretion, allow you to transfer your license to another party, providing the license: <br>
  - has not already been transferred in the previous 12 months; and <br>
  - was purchased more than 30 days in the past. <br>
  - is an active owned license .</p>

</p>
<p class="style2">Installing phpLinkDropper</p>
<p class="style1">Follow the steps below to install your copy of phpLinkDropper</p>
<p class="style1">1. Create a MySQL database on your site to use with phpLinkDropper.</p>
<p class="style1">2. EDIT the config.php with your database information (username, password and database name).</p>
<p class="style1">3. Upload all the files in the phpLinkDropper distribution to your web server in the directory you wish to run it from. PLEASE MAKE SURE TO KEEP THE <br>
  DIRECTORY STRUCTURE INTACT ... OTHERWISE YOUR WEBSITE WILL NOT FUNCTION. You can run the script from any directory you wish on your web server, but the scripts directory structure must stay the same. (i.e. http://www.yourdomain.com/ or http://www.yourdomain.com/links/ or even http://www.yourdomain.com/linktown/links/) </p>
<p class="style1">4. Run install.php via your web browser.</p>
<p class="style1">5. If the install process has worked, you should be able to login to your admin area at http://www.yoursite.com/admin/index.php using the username admin and password admin.</p>
<p class="style1">6. Now you will need to go into the Site Configuration portion of the control panel and make sure to enter in the base url for your site. Make sure to keep <br>
  the trailing / after your domain name (i.e. http://www.yourdomain.com/)</p>
<p class="style1">7. If you plan on turning SE Friendly URLs ON (default is set to ON), make sure to rename the file htaccessfile to .htaccess</p>
<p class="style1">8. IF YOU PLAN ON USING the prune option to delete content that is older than a certain amount of time, then you will need to setup a cronjob to run the file /admin/nightly.php. This file will check the database for any items older than your prune date and remove them. This file also is useful because it will do nightly maintenance on your MySQL database to make sure it is running fine.</p>
<p class="style1">Congratulations! Your new phpLinkDropper site is setup and ready to go!</p>
